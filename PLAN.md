**Web Research Findings Summary:**

My web research into best practices for Vite React deployment in a monorepo, including existing assets and SEO, yielded valuable insights. The key takeaways confirm that a modular, well-configured approach is crucial for performance and maintainability.

*   **Build Optimization:** Techniques like tree shaking, code splitting (which Vite handles well), minification, and asset hashing are essential for reducing bundle size and improving load times.
*   **Environment Management:** Proper use of `.env` files for environment variables is critical, ensuring sensitive data is not exposed client-side.
*   **Deployment Strategy:** Serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Vercel Functions) combined with static hosting (AWS S3 + CloudFront, Vercel) are recommended for Vite React applications, offering scalability and cost-effectiveness. The existing project structure hints at a robust, templated AWS deployment.
*   **Monorepo Integration:** Using package manager workspaces (like pnpm, which you already use) is key for managing local package linking and shared components. Build tools like Nx or Turborepo further optimize caching and task execution.
*   **Asset Management:** Differentiating between app-specific and shared static assets, and leveraging CDNs for delivery, are best practices.
*   **SEO Best Practices:** For optimal search engine visibility, Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) are strongly recommended over pure Client-Side Rendering (CSR). Dynamic meta tags, structured data (JSON-LD), sitemaps, and `robots.txt` are fundamental. Page load performance is also a significant SEO factor.

**Proposal for Site Unification: Leveraging Shadcn/ui for Rapid Rescaffolding & Deployment**

Given your desire to "unify the site with a template," "pick out containers," and ensure compatibility with your existing stack (React, Next.js, TailwindCSS), my research strongly points to **Shadcn/ui** as an excellent choice for components.

Shadcn/ui is not a full-site template but a collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and highly customizable UI components built with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI. You get to copy the component code directly into your project, giving you full control and flexibility. This aligns perfectly with your need to "pick out containers" and ensures seamless integration with your existing styling conventions.

For the base project structure, we will use a fresh **Vite React (TypeScript) project**, which is a modern, fast, and lightweight foundation.

**Revised Detailed Plan:**

**Goal:** Rapidly rescaffold and deploy a clean, functional, and SEO-optimized `social_calendar` application using Shadcn/ui components, integrating existing copy, assets, and SEO guidelines.

**Phase 1: Project Setup & Initialization**

1.  **Create New Vite Project (`social_calendar_clean`):**
    *   Initialize a new Vite React (TypeScript) project.
    *   Initialize a new Git repository within this directory for a clean history.

2.  **Integrate Tailwind CSS & Shadcn/ui:**
    *   Follow the official Shadcn/ui setup guide for Vite/React to configure Tailwind CSS and add necessary utilities.
    *   Install and configure the `@shadcn/ui` CLI.

**Phase 2: Component & Code Migration**

1.  **Select & Install Core Shadcn/ui Components:**
    *   From the Shadcn/ui documentation (e.g., [https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components)), you can visually choose components like `Button`, `Card`, `Dialog`, `Input`, `Select`, etc.
    *   For each chosen component, I will use the Shadcn/ui CLI to add it to our new project (e.g., `pnpm dlx shadcn-ui@latest add button`).

2.  **Migrate Existing Code & Assets:**
    *   **Essential Client-Side Code:** Copy `App.tsx`, `pages/Home.tsx` (and other relevant pages), `events.ts`, `const.ts`, and any custom `components/`, `contexts/`, `hooks/`, `lib/` directories from `C:/Vercel/social_calendar/calendar_source/client/src/` to `social_calendar_clean/src/`.
    *   **Adjust Imports:** Update import paths as necessary to match the new project structure and leverage Shadcn/ui components where they replace old custom components.
    *   **Static Assets:** Copy `og-image.png` and other static assets from `C:/Vercel/social_calendar/public/` to `social_calendar_clean/public`.

**Phase 3: Configuration & SEO Integration**

1.  **Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`):**
    *   Ensure aliases (e.g., `@` for `src/`) are correctly configured.
    *   Set up build output and other optimizations.
    *   Potentially configure SSR if desired for enhanced SEO.

2.  **TypeScript Configuration (`tsconfig.json`):**
    *   Verify the `tsconfig.json` generated by Vite is appropriate for a Shadcn/ui project, including `baseUrl` and `paths`.

3.  **SEO Integration (`index.html` & Dynamic Meta Tags):**
    *   Copy the existing `C:/Vercel/social_calendar/index.html` to `social_calendar_clean/index.html`. This file is already rich with meta tags, JSON-LD, and canonical URLs.
    *   Adjust `script src` and `preload` links for `main.tsx` if necessary to match the new `src/` path.
    *   Ensure dynamic meta tags (if any) in the React components are correctly implemented and updated.

4.  **`robots.txt`:**
    *   Create a permissive `social_calendar_clean/public/robots.txt`:
        ```
        User-agent: *
        Allow: /
        ```

**Phase 4: Build, Test & Deployment**

1.  **Install Dependencies:** Run `pnpm install` in `social_calendar_clean`.
2.  **Build Project:** Run `pnpm build` in `social_calendar_clean`.
3.  **Local Testing:** Run `pnpm dev` and `pnpm preview` in `social_calendar_clean` to ensure functionality.
4.  **Deployment (Vercel):** Deploy `social_calendar_clean` as a standalone Vercel project using `vercel --prod` (after configuring environment variables).

**Phase 5: Verifying Site Integrity**

To ensure the integrity of the newly unified and deployed site, what specific checks would you like me to perform? For example:
*   Successful Vercel deployment with no build errors.
*   No runtime errors in the browser console.
*   All pages load correctly.
*   SEO meta tags are present and correct in the rendered HTML.
*   Responsive design is maintained.
*   Specific functional tests (e.g., calendar filtering works).
