Agent 6 - Marketing Research & Conversion Experience
====================================================
Mandate
-------
Translate current market signals into page structure, messaging, and backlog items for the landing funnels powering this sprint. (Sources: wordstream_landing.txt, shopify_landing.txt, cxl_b2b.txt, backlinko_onpage.txt, nng_homepage.txt, smashing_form_validation.txt)

Market & UX Insights
--------------------
1. Proven landing-page levers (WordStream)  
   - Keep ad-to-landing page alignment tight: copy on the page must echo the promise from each campaign and explain next steps immediately (wordstream_landing.txt).  
   - Simplify forms (<=7 inputs), respect whitespace, and only capture data you will actually use.  
   - Treat copy and CTAs as perpetual experiments; use headers, subheads, and bullets rather than walls of text, and A/B test both tone and CTA labels regularly.  
   - Prioritize scannable layouts that foreground the offer; clutter-heavy designs bury the conversion paths.
2. Competitive cues from 404s (still valuable)  
   - CXL's now-missing "B2B landing page best practices" link funnels visitors toward AI-focused courses ("Build optimized B2B content funnels with AI", "Fix ABM measurement with funnel attribution.", "LinkedIn thought leader ads"), signaling that enterprise buyers expect AI-shaped messaging and ABM measurement insights (cxl_b2b.txt).  
   - Backlinko's on-page SEO hub currently routes traffic to AI-search strategy articles ("LLM Seeding", "Generative Engine Optimization"), reinforcing that our content should cover AI visibility and entity SEO even on traditional landing pages (backlinko_onpage.txt).  
   - Shopify's nav-heavy 404 highlights the four solution pillars (Start, Sell, Market, Manage) that resonate with commerce operators; mirroring that structure can help position our own offerings (shopify_landing.txt).  
   - NN/g's broken homepage guideline link is a reminder that credibility cues (trust badges, privacy/cookie transparency) must be explicit because authoritative references are not always reachable (nng_homepage.txt).  
   - Smashing Magazine's 404 for form-validation UX underscores the need to keep a living backlog of validation best practices rather than relying on dated articles; capture our own guidelines (smashing_form_validation.txt).

Action Plan
-----------
- Build a messaging map that ties each acquisition channel to a dedicated landing-page variant whose hero copy matches ad copy verbatim (WordStream insight).  
- Inventory every active form, remove fields that are not actionable, and pair with Agent 5 to ensure validation/focus states do not harm CLS.  
- Draft internal briefs summarizing the AI-heavy themes competitors emphasize (CXL + Backlinko) so creative knows which angles to test first.  
- Add a research task to source up-to-date NN/g or Baymard findings on homepage credibility and form validation, replacing the dead links referenced above.
