## DALL-E IMPLEMENTATION WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Generate via OpenAI API
```python
# scripts/generate-images.py
from openai import OpenAI
import os

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

images_to_generate = [
    {
        "prompt": "Photorealistic 3D render of a modern AI automation dashboard...",

        prompt=img["prompt"],
        size=img["size"],
        quality="hd",  # Higher quality for hero images

    )
    
    image_url = response.data[0].url

## SEO OPTIMIZATION FOR IMAGES

### Filename Convention
```
[page]-[element]-[description]-[variant].extension

Examples:
✅ homepage-hero-ai-dashboard-desktop.webp
✅ services-flowstack-workflow-builder-mobile.webp
✅ about-team-cleveland-office-wide.jpg
✅ icon-cadence-brand-rhythm.svg

❌ IMG_1234.jpg
❌ screenshot.png
❌ image-final-v2-FINAL.jpg
```

### Alt Text Strategy (SEO + Accessibility)

**Formula:**
[What's in the image] + [Context/Action] + [Keywords naturally included]

**Examples:**

✅ **GOOD:**
```
"AI automation dashboard showing workflow connections between Gmail, Slack, Salesforce and Airtable for small business efficiency"
```
- Descriptive of visual content
- Includes primary keywords (AI automation, workflow, small business)
- Under 125 characters
- Naturally written

❌ **BAD:**
```
"dashboard screenshot"
"AI automation AI tools automation platform small business"  (keyword stuffing)
"Click here to see our AI dashboard"  (no description)
""  (empty - accessibility violation)
```

### Image Structured Data (Schema.org)
```tsx
// components/schemas/ImageSchema.tsx
export function ImageObjectSchema({ image }: { image: ImageData }) {
  const schema = {
    '@context': 'https://schema.org',
    '@type': 'ImageObject',
    contentUrl: `https://bespokethos.com${image.src}`,
    creditText: 'Bespoke Ethos',
    creator: {
