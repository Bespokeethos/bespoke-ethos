# Codex Agent Briefing Package: Bespoke Ethos Sprint 1

**Objective:** Verify and test the Airtable integration for the Bespoke Ethos website.

## 1. Your Mission

Your teammates have completed the initial coding for Airtable integration. Your mission is to:

1.  **Set up** the required Airtable base and credentials.
2.  **Test** the contact and newsletter forms thoroughly on your local machine.
3.  **Deploy** the changes to production.
4.  **Verify** everything works on the live site.
5.  **Document** your findings and hand off to the next agent (Manus).

This package contains all the guides and scripts you need. Follow them step-by-step.

## 2. Package Contents

-   `README.md`: This file.
-   `guides/01_Airtable_Setup.md`: Step-by-step guide to creating your Airtable base and getting credentials.

2.  **Read `guides/02_Local_Testing_Protocol.md`** and run all tests.
3.  **Read `guides/03_Deployment_and_Verification.md`** to push your changes and verify the live site.
4.  **Fill out `templates/Verification_Report.md`** with your results.
5.  **Commit and push** your completed verification report.

## 4. Critical: Use Your Tools

This is a high-inference task. You are expected to use your tools proactively to diagnose and solve problems. **Do not guess. Verify.**

-   **Use `cat`, `ls`, `grep`** to inspect code and logs.
-   **Use `curl`** to test API endpoints directly.
-   **Use the browser** to test the user interface and inspect network traffic.
-   **Research** any errors you encounter.

Good luck, agent.
