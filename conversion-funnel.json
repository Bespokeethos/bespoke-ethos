Based on the described structure of bespokeethos.com, here are the **top 3 conversion killers** along with **specific fixes and example copy** to improve user engagement and conversion rates:

**Conversion Killer:**  
Rotating text can dilute the message if it changes too quickly or is unclear, causing visitors to miss the core value proposition. Visitors need an immediate understanding of what the brand offers and why it matters.

**Fix:**

**Example Copy:**  
**Headline:**  
*“Transform Your Workforce with Bespoke Ethos — Inclusive, Certified, and Proven.”*

**Subheadline:**  
*“Explore our innovative solutions: Cadence, Flowstack, Consensus Engine, and Redbridging — designed to empower your team.”*
