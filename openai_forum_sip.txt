Welcome to the OpenAI Developer Community, a forum for **developers to meet and chat with other developers** while building with OpenAIΓÇÖs APIs and developer platform.

This is not a place for ChatGPT discussion (with the exception of ChatGPT developer tools, like Codex). ChatGPT discussion takes place in the [OpenAI Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/openai).

What to know:

1.   This forum is community-run and maintained. Not all posts are monitored. To get in touch with OpenAI, reach out at [https://help.openai.com/en/?q=contact](https://help.openai.com/en/?q=contact).
2.   Discussions related to the ChatGPT app and plans will be hidden, and your account may be suspended. (We must keep conversations focused on technical topics related to building with OpenAI, for the sake of the larger community here.)
3.   Before posting a new topic, please [search the forum](https://community.openai.com/search) for similar topics. This prevents duplicate discussions.

IΓÇÖve built a AI voice assistant using the Realtime API and connected it with a caller using an SIP connection with Twilio. The call is initiated when the caller dials my Twilio number, and Twilio creates an SIP connection with OpenAI. When the call connects, the AI is fantastic. But very frequently (at least 10% of the time) the call doesnΓÇÖt connect. On these occasions, the phone doesnΓÇÖt ring and my server is never sent the realtime.call.incoming webhook. After 10 seconds or so, Twilio gives up on connecting the call and sends the caller to a backup option (redirecting to a different phone number).

Because Twilio is never dropping the call, IΓÇÖm lead to believe that the problem is OpenAI receiving the SIP connection, but when IΓÇÖve observed this problem there has never been an issue listed on the OpenAI Status page. Has anyone else experienced this issue? Is this a known problem? Are there improvements scheduled for the Realtime SIP connection? I didnΓÇÖt have these issues when I was using my server as a middleman and connecting to Twilio and OpenAI through websocket connections.
