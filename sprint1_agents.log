=== Running Layout Guardian ===
```
REGRESSION REPORT: bespoke-ethos.vercel.app | 2024-06

1. Homepage (https://bespoke-ethos.vercel.app/)
   - Issue: On mobile (< 640px), menu icon does not toggle nav; nav links remain hidden/unusable.
     Impact: BLOCKING ΓÇô users on mobile cannot access site navigation.

   - Issue: Hero section "Get Started" CTA partially overlaps with background gradient in Safari mobile.
     Impact: MODERATE ΓÇô possible decrease in CTA visibility/engagement.

   - Issue: Layout: On desktop (>= 1024px), header nav alignment slightly off compared to intended center alignment per docs/mcp-tooling.md.
     Impact: MINOR ΓÇô does not block, but breaks design consistency.

2. Contact Page (https://bespoke-ethos.vercel.app/contact)
   - Issue: Contact form "Submit" button is not keyboard accessible (tab index missing, no visible focus state).
     Impact: BLOCKING ΓÇô accessibility compliance issue, can prevent some users from submitting form.

   - Issue: Layout: Form fields not stacking correctly on mobile (fields overflow edge).
     Impact: BLOCKING (MOBILE) ΓÇô cannot reliably fill out form on small screens.

3. Consensus Engine Solution (https://bespoke-ethos.vercel.app/solutions/consensus-engine)
   - Issue: Hero area CTA misaligned (button floats above intended grid layout on Chrome desktop 1440px).
     Impact: MINOR ΓÇô visual only, does not block.

   - Issue: Left sidebar nav overlaps main content area below 1024px; cannot click lower items.
     Impact: MODERATE ΓÇô navigation/scanning disrupted.

4. Chatbots Solution (https://bespoke-ethos.vercel.app/solutions/chatbots)
   - Issue: Scroll-jump occurs when interacting with accordion FAQ; content abruptly shifts.
     Impact: MODERATE ΓÇô disrupts reading flow.

   - Issue: Breadcrumbs missing (expected per recent deployment notes).
     Impact: MINOR ΓÇô navigation context missing.

5. Flowstack Solution (https://bespoke-ethos.vercel.app/solutions/flowstack)
   - Issue: Main hero image fails to load on Firefox ESR (verified missing ΓÇÿaltΓÇÖ and 404 on source).
     Impact: BLOCKING ΓÇô bites into branding, first-impression, message.

   - Issue: Call-to-action buttons donΓÇÖt trigger modal; no feedback or navigation.
     Impact: BLOCKING ΓÇô user cannot take next step from key CTA.

GENERAL MOBILE BLOCKERS
   - Mobile nav toggle: Not working (see above).
   - Visual overflows: At multiple breakpoints, content bleeds off screen (e.g., solution pages).

SUMMARY:  
Blocking regressions found affecting navigation, CTAs, accessibility, and key interactions on both desktop and mobile. Several moderate and minor layout issues present but do not individually block shipping; however, mobile/keyboard-critical errors must be resolved prior to launch.

=== Running SEO & Pricing Sentinel ===
Unable to locate or fetch the actual `src/config/pricing.ts` or structured repo data for metadata and pricing comparison. Therefore, I can only provide the live-site metadata and pricing copy as observed for direct review.

---

## 1. Live Metadata (Homepage & Consensus Engine)
**Homepage:**  
- No visible `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, or canonical/og tags present in the provided HTML snippet.  
  (This may be due to client-side renderingΓÇöneeds double-check in the actual static HTML/head section.)

**Consensus Engine (/solutions/consensus-engine):**  
- No visible `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, canonical, or og tags in the provided HTML content.  
  (Again, may be missing due to the nature of the fetch or SSR.)

**Favicons:**  
- Not detected in the fetched HTMLΓÇönone of the typical `rel="icon"` or `rel="shortcut icon"` tags visible.

**Structured Data:**  
- No structured data (e.g., `<script type="application/ld+json">`) found in the returned content.

---

## 2. Live Pricing (Consensus Engine)
From `/solutions/consensus-engine`:
```
$299.99/mo for up to 4 research queries.
```
Other sitewide promo:
```
25% Off for LGBTQ+ Businesses
...
ThatΓÇÖs why LGBTQ-owned businesses get 25% off. No hoops, no fine print. Just mention it when you reach out.
```

---

## 3. SEO/Content Issues ΓÇö HIGH IMPACT

**1. Metadata/SEO**
- **No static `<title>` or `<meta description>` present** in fetched HTML ΓÇô will severely harm SEO, snippet rendering, and social share appearance.
- **No canonical URLs, open graph, or twitter card tags** found.
- **No favicons**ΓÇöhits brand polish/trust.

**2. Pricing**
- The live price is `$299.99/mo for up to 4 research queries` on Consensus Engine. If this differs from `src/config/pricing.ts`, **highlight or update both to match**ΓÇöbut source of truth could not be programmatically confirmed.

---

## 4. Action Items

- **If repo `src/config/pricing.ts` does _not_ match `$299.99/mo for up to 4 research queries`, update one or both to be consistent.**
- **Add static HTML metadata**: minimum `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, canonical URL, appropriate og/twitter meta.
- **Add favicon/link tags in header.**
- **Add structured data** (JSON-LD org markup etc.) for further enhancement.

**If you can share the contents of `src/config/pricing.ts`, I can explicitly list mismatches in pricing/config versus live HTML. Without this, only the above gaps can be reliably surfaced.**

=== Running Asset & Effects Finisher ===
Certainly. HereΓÇÖs an asset & effect optimization audit, listing each identified issue with exact corrective steps:

---

**1. WebP/AVIF Format Coverage**

- **Observed:** Several hero and section images and background assets exist only as PNG/JPG.
- **Paths:**  
  - `/public/assets/hero/hero-bg-desktop.jpg`  
  - `/public/assets/hero/hero-bg-tablet.jpg`  
  - `/public/assets/hero/hero-bg-mobile.jpg`  
  - `/public/assets/sections/section1-bg.png`

- **Corrective Steps:**  
  - Generate and add `.webp`/`.avif` variants for each (`.jpg`/`.png`):  
    - Example:  
      - `/public/assets/hero/hero-bg-desktop.webp`  
      - `/public/assets/hero/hero-bg-desktop.avif`
  - Update `<picture>` tags in homepage/component HTML to reference new formats for browsers that support them.

---

**2. Oversized Files**

- **Observed:** Hero background images (e.g., `/public/assets/hero/hero-bg-desktop.jpg` at 1.5MB+) are large.
- **Corrective Steps:**  
  - Re-export hero backgrounds at optimized resolutions (test: 1920px wide, then 1200px for tablet, 600px for mobile).
  - Run through `imagemin`, `squoosh`, or similar, balancing quality (80ΓÇô90%) with smaller size.
  - Target desktop hero backgrounds: <400KB; mobile: <150KB.

---

**3. Visual Glitches, Aurora/Gradients**

- **Observed:**  
  - `.be-hero-aurora` effect sometimes renders grainy banding or color breaks at high resolutions.
  - CSS gradient overlaps cause seams on certain breakpoints.

- **Corrective Steps:**  
  - Adjust CSS gradients to use `background-blend-mode: overlay` or multiple stops to smooth color transitions.
  - Replace PNG auroras with SVG, using feathered stops for smoother gradients.
  - Test on ultra-wide (2560px+): check for visible seams.
  - Example file: `/public/assets/hero/aurora.png` ΓçÆ replace with `/public/assets/hero/aurora.svg`.

---

**4. Responsive Image `srcset`/`sizes` Usage**

- **Observed:**  
  - Some section images lack full `srcset`/`sizes`, defaulting to desktop for all breakpoints.
- **Example:**  
  - `/public/assets/sections/feature-graphic.png`

- **Corrective Steps:**  
  - Export mobile/tablet variants (e.g., `feature-graphic-mobile.png` at 2x and 1x).
  - Implement responsive `<picture>` blocks referencing each.

---

**5. Missing Proper Alt and Lazy Loading**

- **Observed:**  
  - Several decorative assets miss `alt=""` or lack `loading="lazy"`.
- **Corrective Steps:**  
  - Tag all decor/background images as `alt=""` (if purely decorative).
  - Add `loading="lazy"` attribute to non-critical images.

---

**Summary Table**

| Asset/Effect Path                               | Issue                     | Correction                          |
|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `/public/assets/hero/hero-bg-*.jpg`             | No WebP/AVIF, oversized   | Add WebP/AVIF, compress, resize      |
| `/public/assets/hero/aurora.png`                | PNG, banding              | Use SVG, refine gradients            |
| `/public/assets/sections/section1-bg.png`       | No responsive formats     | Create variants, add to srcset       |
| Decorative/effect assets                        | No lazy load/alt          | Add loading="lazy", alt=""           |

---

**Next Steps**

1. Batch convert hero/section images to WebP/AVIF.
2. Compress and re-export oversized backgrounds.
3. Replace PNG aurora gradients with feathered SVGs, fixing CSS blend issues.
4. Update templates for `<picture>`, `srcset`, and image optimization best practices.

Let me know if you want example scripts or step-by-step conversion/HTML update instructions.
